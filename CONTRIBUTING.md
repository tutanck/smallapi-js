## Semantic Versioning

We follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). We release patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features, and major versions for any breaking changes. When we make breaking changes, we also introduce deprecation warnings in a minor version so that our users learn about the upcoming changes and migrate their code in advance.

Every significant change is documented in the [release notes](https://github.com/tutanck/smallapi-js/releases/latest).

## Style Guide

We use an automatic code formatter called [Prettier](https://prettier.io).
Run `npm run format` after making any changes to the code.

Then, our linter will catch most issues that may exist in your code. You can check the status of your code styling by simply running `npm run lint`.
